It uses large language model like Chat6PT to write the code. 

It allows everyone to build their own apps just by using Englisch descriptions of the invisioned app and absolutly no programming or computer science background is needed.

Even though it is targeted to non programers even Programmers can quickly generate a prototype app and test their ideas. 

If you like the app and want to develop it further it is also possible to copy the code to your developer pc to further enhance and improve it.
